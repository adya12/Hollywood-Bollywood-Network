# Hollywood-Bollywood-Network
This repository contains the code and analysis for a comparative network study of collaboration patterns in Hollywood and Bollywood. Using a curated dataset of films and cast lists sourced from Kaggle, the project examines how actors in each industry connect through co-appearances and how these collaboration structures evolve over time.
