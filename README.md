Hollywood–Bollywood Collaboration Network Analysis

This repository contains the code, data-processing pipeline, and analysis for a comparative network study of Hollywood and Bollywood film industries. Using a cleaned Kaggle dataset of movies and cast lists, we construct bipartite actor–movie graphs, project them into actor–actor collaboration networks, and analyze how these networks evolve over time using five-year sliding windows (2012–2016 through 2018–2022).

The project explores three main questions:

How do collaboration structures differ between Hollywood and Bollywood over time?

Do actors in each industry work together more often than expected by chance?

Does early network position help predict later career success?

The repository includes the code helps in :

Data-cleaning and preprocessing scripts

Bipartite network construction and actor–actor projection

Temporal network metrics across sliding windows

A bipartite configuration-model null framework for repeated-collaboration evaluation

Actor-level trajectory analysis linking early centrality to later popularity


Overall, this project highlights structural differences between the two industries, demonstrates the strongly non-random nature of repeated partnerships, and examines how collaboration networks shape career trajectories.
